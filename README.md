# Lab-Code--CmptrProbSolv
Here are lab assignments from my ME EN 1010 course that taught me the basics of MATLAB and Arduino. These series of labs would become essential pieces for my final "Virtual Mechatronic System" project. All credit of the creation of these assignments goes to Dr. Debra Mascaro of the University of Utah. However, the written code was developed all on my own and my coding partner.
